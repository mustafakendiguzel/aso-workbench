# Command line (`aso`)

`aso` is the ASO Workbench engine without the macOS interface. It uses the same rules as the app (`ASOCore`) and the same App Store adapters (`ASOProviders`), keeps its own data file, and is the foundation for the Windows and Linux versions. It builds on every platform listed under [Platforms](ARCHITECTURE.md#platforms).

The same honesty rules apply: "> 200" means *not in the top 200 results* (never rank 201), a failed request is stored as a failure, and a number that has no source is left empty instead of guessed.

## Build

```bash
swift build -c release --product aso
.build/release/aso --help
```

See [Platforms](ARCHITECTURE.md#platforms) for the toolchain and system libraries each platform needs.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `aso app add <App Store link or ID> [--country CC]` | Starts tracking an app (looked up in the link's country, else `--country`, else US). |
| `aso app list` | Tracked apps. |
| `aso app remove <app ID>` | Stops tracking an app and deletes its keywords and measurements. |
| `aso keywords add <app ID> <keyword>... --country CC [--device iphone\|ipad\|mac]` | Tracks keywords in one market. Duplicates (ignoring case and spacing) are skipped. |
| `aso keywords remove <app ID> <keyword>... --country CC [--device ...]` | Stops tracking keywords. |
| `aso keywords list <app ID> [--country CC] [--device ...] [--delta previous\|first\|week]` | Latest rank, Δ, difficulty and brand verdict per keyword. |
| `aso measure <app ID> [--country CC] [--device ...] [--depth 1-200]` | A fresh rank check for every keyword, about 3 seconds each (Apple limits public search). Progress goes to stderr. |
| `aso search <term> --country CC [--device ...] [--limit 1-200]` | Top results for a term right now. Nothing is stored. |
| `aso hints <seed> --country CC` | App Store autocomplete for a prefix. |
| `aso difficulty <term> --country CC [--device ...]` | Difficulty (0–100) from the top ten results, with every component. |
| `aso validate [--title T] [--subtitle S] [--keywords K]` | Checks metadata against the App Store limits; exits with 1 when a hard limit is broken. |

A quick start:

```bash
aso app add "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480"
aso keywords add 361285480 "presentation" "slides maker" --country US
aso measure 361285480
aso keywords list 361285480
```

Keywords that start with `-` go after `--`: `aso keywords add 361285480 --country US -- -keyword`.

## Output and exit codes

- Text by default; `--json` prints machine-readable JSON on stdout (dates in ISO 8601; an absent value, such as the rank of a keyword outside the results, is left out rather than written as a number). Progress, warnings and errors always go to stderr, so JSON output can be piped.
- With `--json`, `measure` writes its progress to stderr as JSON Lines, one object per measured keyword:
  `{"completed":1,"keyword":"notes","market":"US · iphone","outcome":"#12","status":"found","total":20}` (`status` is `found`, `outside`, `failed` or `notChecked`).
- `difficulty --json` gives the score, its tier, the sample size and every component with its name, weight and explanation, exactly as the engine weighs them.
- Exit codes: `0` success, `1` the command failed (the message says why), `64` the command was called wrongly (the usage follows). `validate` exits with `1` when a hard limit is broken and still prints the issues.
- Global options (`--json`, `--data-dir`) may come before the command; keywords and terms that start with `-` go after `--`.

## Data

The data file is `engine.sqlite` in the data folder:

| Platform | Default folder |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ASO Workbench/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/ASO Workbench/` (usually `~/.local/share/ASO Workbench/`) |
| Windows | the user's application data folder, `ASO Workbench\` |

`ASO_DATA_DIR` or `--data-dir PATH` choose another folder. The file is plain SQLite: back it up by copying it while `aso` is not running, start over by deleting it. On macOS it sits next to the app's `store.sqlite` but never shares its format; the app does not read it.

The schema is versioned (`PRAGMA user_version`) and migrated forward automatically. A data file written by a newer version is refused rather than rewritten.

## Not yet in the command line

Popularity (Apple Ads), publishing (App Store Connect), the AI writer (OpenRouter) and revenue (RevenueCat) need keys and arrive in later steps. Until then `popularity` is `null` and no keyword is marked golden, because golden needs a popularity value.
